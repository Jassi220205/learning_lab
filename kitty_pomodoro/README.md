🐱 Kitty Pomodoro – A Playful, ADHD-Friendly Productivity Timer

Kitty Pomodoro is a soft-aesthetic, cat-themed Pomodoro timer designed especially for neurodivergent minds seeking gentle focus tools. Featuring a cheerful cat that walks, runs, and plays around a pastel-toned Pomodoro box, this project blends cuteness, calm, and function into one accessible experience.

🎨 Aesthetic & Accessibility
Crafted in soothing shades of light blue and pink, with support for both light and dark modes, Kitty Pomodoro creates a gentle workspace for users who find traditional productivity tools overstimulating or dull. Its animated kitty companion adds just the right touch of joyful distraction without pulling you out of focus.
